  <h1>Our Commitment to Sustainability</h1>
  <p>We believe good skincare shouldn’t come at the cost of the planet. Every bar we make reflects care — for your skin, and for the earth.</p>

  <h2>Thoughtful Ingredients</h2>
  <p>
    We use responsibly sourced botanicals and natural oils — ingredients that are gentle on your skin and kind to the environment.  
    No harsh chemicals. No synthetic fragrances. Only nature’s goodness.
  </p>

  <h2>Plastic-Free Packaging</h2>
  <p>
    Our soaps are wrapped in biodegradable paper and shipped in recyclable boxes.  
    We’re committed to keeping single-use plastic out of our process.
  </p>

  <h2>Small-Batch Production</h2>
  <p>
    We handcraft our soaps in small batches to reduce waste and maintain quality.  
    Each bar is made with intention — not mass-produced.
  </p>

  <h2>Responsible Sourcing</h2>
  <p>
    We partner with trusted local suppliers who share our values of fair trade and ethical sourcing.  
    Supporting sustainable agriculture is part of our mission.
  </p>

  <h2>Continuous Growth</h2>
  <p>
    Sustainability isn’t a destination — it’s a journey.  
    We’re constantly exploring better materials, greener shipping, and more mindful ways to create.
