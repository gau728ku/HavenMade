    <h1>Our Story</h1>
    <p>
      HavenMade began with a simple intention — to return to the roots of true skincare.
      In a world filled with chemical-laden products, we believed there was a better way:
      one that’s kind to your skin and to the planet.
    </p>

    <h2>Crafted with Love</h2>
    <p>
      Each HavenMade soap is carefully handmade using natural oils, botanicals, and
      essential ingredients that nourish and rejuvenate. No harsh chemicals. No shortcuts.
      Only goodness.
    </p>

    <h2>More Than a Brand</h2>
    <p>
      HavenMade isn’t just a name — it’s a reminder to live gently and mindfully.
      Every bar we make celebrates simplicity, self-care, and our connection to nature.
    </p>

    <p class="signature">With love,<br><strong>The HavenMade Family</strong></p>
